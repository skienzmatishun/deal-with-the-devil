## The Truth of Friday, May 13th 2005
### Place: Baldwin County Courthouse
#### Bay Minette, Alabama

Jarious McNeil was the last person to be seen with Brandon Hastings. McNeil was the person who was selling parts off of Hastings car.  While being questioned by the investigating officers, McNeil changed his story four times.  The last story from McNeil was that Murray Lawrence Jr. shot Hastings in the head during the robbery, and that blood was everywhere.  McNeil said that he and Lawrence planned to dispose of the body, and that they put the body in the trunk of the car, and later drove one and one half hours one way to Mississippi.

Forensic pathologist, after finding Hastings body, stated that he died of strangulation.  This pathologist has examined more than 1,000 bodies.

A weapon was turned in because of a rumor that Hastings was shot in the head 18 times.  Jarious McNeil gave this weapon to a friend and co-worker at the time of Brandon Hastings disappearance.  Forensic scientists exhumed Hastings body again, and came to the conclusion, for a second time, that Brandon Hastings died of strangulation.

There are no entry or exit wounds on Brandon Hastings skull, according to the forensic scientist conclusions.

Number one Reasonable doubt... a convicted felon changing his mind and story after he is charged with capitol murder, which carries the death penalty.  McNeil has been in and out of trouble with the law for years.  He has been kicked out of the military and was also caught counterfeiting in Fairhope, AL.

Reasonable doubt... McNeil took investigating officers to the supposed crime scene looking for shell casings. No shell casings were found after 3 to 4 hours of searching (reasonable doubt). Prosecutors stated that maybe the shell didn't eject from the weapon.  Not on investigating officer checked the weapon to see if the weapon had any problems ejecting the shells from being fired.  This was very sloppy and unprofessional of the investigating officers.

The finger print exper stated the best place to get fingerprints from a car, is the door handle.  McNeil stated that Murray Lawrence Jr. rode with him on and one half hours to Mississippi and one and one half hours back to Fairhope, Alabama.  The only finger prints found in or on the car was of Jarious McNeil and his stepbrother, and also an unidentified set of fingerprints.

McNeil stated that Hastings body was placed in the trunk of the car, and blood was everywhere. McNeil showed investigators supposedly where Hastings head was.
