excerpt: Among the personal items that former Baldwin County District Attorney David Whetstone left behind after leaving office in 2006, easily the most curious was a wooden statue of a devil. 'Devil statue is mine â€” and it seems cursed'

---

Former Baldwin County District Attorney David Whetstone left behind a wooden devil statue after stepping down in 2006. The current District Attorney, Hallie Dixon, recently found the statue along with boxes of Whetstone's personal belongings in a storage area. Whetstone's sons had found the statue on the Fort Morgan peninsula in the mid-1980s. He brought it to work but noticed a pattern of bad luck and illness among those who encountered it. He had to hide it in his office as the cleaning staff refused to clean when it was visible. The statue eventually ended up in an evidence room, and Whetstone lost track of it. He made it clear that the statue would not go to his house, as his wife doesn't want it there.
