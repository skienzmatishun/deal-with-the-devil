A federal judge has dismissed Baldwin County as a defendant in a lawsuit stemming from a deadly 2018 eviction in Fairhope, where a 65-year-old man was fatally shot during a SWAT standoff after an eviction order. However, claims against Sheriff Huey “Hoss” Mack, several deputies, and the landlords remain in the case. Additionally, Sheriff Mack was also dismissed as a defendant in a separate lawsuit brought by the survivors of a deadly wrong-way vehicle pursuit on Interstate 10 in 2019, while claims against the involved police officer and the Town of Loxley continue.
