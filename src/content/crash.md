A federal judge has dismissed Baldwin County as a defendant in a lawsuit stemming from a deadly 2018 eviction in Fairhope, where a 65-year-old man was fatally shot during a SWAT standoff after an eviction order. However, claims against Sheriff Huey “Hoss” Mack, several deputies, and the landlords remain in the case. Additionally, Sheriff Mack was also dismissed as a defendant in a separate lawsuit brought by the survivors of a deadly wrong-way vehicle pursuit on Interstate 10 in 2019, while claims against the involved police officer and the Town of Loxley continue.

>If your father and brother were driving on a trip and somewhere along the way, in a place called Baldwin County, Alabama, they died after being hit head-on by a car that was chased the wrong way down I-10 by a sheriff’s deputy, you’d want answers. If you were a family member of one of the three people in the car that killed that father and son, and your child was incinerated in that fiery crash, you’d want to know as much as possible about how this all came to pass.
